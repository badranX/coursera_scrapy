```console
python crawl.py "your-category-like-data-science"
```

Was built with python 10+ and scrappy version 1+. It outputs a simple "out.csv" file and uploads the file to a simple flask server. check: <http://badranx.pythonanywhere.com/out.html>

The script doesn't just parse courses but different items (e.g. "degrees"). The last column indicate the item type, in case you want to remove them.
