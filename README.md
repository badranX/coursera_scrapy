Simply run 

``console
python crawl.py "your-category-like-data-science"
```
It simply uploads the file to a simple flask server on: <http://badranx.pythonanywhere.com/out.html>

The script doesn't just parse courses but different items (e.g. "degrees"). The last column indicate the item type. Only courses are supposed to have all the features filled.
